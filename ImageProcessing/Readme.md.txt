Hello there,
The code you can find in this folder is written in java.
What it does is, it takes an image as user input (--> you'll have to open the code and replace your image's path to be processed)
Once it gets the image, it changes it to its negative.
This is done by altering the hex of RGB by its inverse (255 - current value) for each pixel

After processing the image, it saves it in a directory that has been put in the code.(You'll  have to replace this with your own directory)

**Thank you!**
